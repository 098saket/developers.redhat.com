# jboss-developer-site


## Development

If you are working on the CSS, make sure to also run `compass watch`

New pages should be added to the root with the extension `.html.slim`

### Updating the DCP

Updates to the DCP should happen automatically if the build is being done on the build server, however, if
it is down or there is another emergency situation and the site needs to be built and content pushed to the
DCP for staging or production please contact Pete Muir, Jason Porter, Andrew Rubinger or Ray Ploski. Below
are steps to setup the environment for pushing content to the DCP.

In order to update content in the DCP you must have the URL set in config.yaml and the following two environment variables set: 

    export dcp_user=jboss-developer
    export dcp_password=<see one of the people above for this>

If these two variables are not set you will see a warning during the build:

    Missing username and / or password for searchisko

You can then preview the staging site, which will also push data to the DCP staging server:

    rake preview[staging]
    
Alterntively, you can preview/deploy to staging or production and the asociated DCP server will also be updated.

## Deployment

Run `rake deploy[staging]` or `rake deploy[production]`

To tag:

`rake deploy[staging,tagname]`

To run in Awestruct in development mode, execute:

`rake`

To run Awestruct while developing, execute:

`rake preview`

To clean the generated site before you build, execute:

`rake clean preview`

To deploy using the production profile, execute:

`rake deploy`

To get a list of all tasks, execute:

`rake -T`

Now you're Awestruct with rake!
