== Solution Overview
Innovation demands the ability to experiment and learn, fail fast, while still delivering on time.  Developers must be free to focus on their applications, and not be hampered by the need to provision, configure and secure their application infrastructure. IT Operations can't be saddled with yet more maintenance responsibilities, especially when rapid innovation can mean multiple new stacks that may only be short lived. Architects need to provide an environment that maximizes productivity, minimizes cost and risk, and scales rapidly and securely.

The latest generation of application platforms, integration buses, and process automation suites - , while an improvement over earlier homegrown solutions, -  falls short of delivering critical functionality on-demand without the need to acquire, provision and maintain application infrastructure.  As the DevOps culture become more prevalent and necessary, IT organizations have to evolve.  But most don't have the luxury of flipping a switch.  They need to live in both worlds, maintaining legacy while deploying new and integrate between the two.

Middleware—the right middleware— is the cornerstone of innovation for any enterprise that depends on IT for differentiation.  When critical functionality for application development and deployment, integration, and process automation are available on-demand, the things that should be consistent actually are consistent, risk is reduced and agility is improved.  IT can unlock the value of existing legacy systems, scale systems to support the massive amounts of requests and data, experiment with new solutions quickly and efficiently, and do it all in a safe, secure environment to protect the organization from risk.  Bottom line, the choice of middleware is strategic for the executive as the basis for adapting in an uncertain future. Red Hat’s Enterprise Java solutions enable enterprises to innovate faster though enlightened innovation.
