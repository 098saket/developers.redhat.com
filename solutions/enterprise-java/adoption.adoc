### [[accelerate]]Accelerate
#### [[accelerate-development]]Accelerate Development
Don't let a complex, inflexible, proprietary application infrastructure hinder your developers' productivity. Create applications faster. Deploy them across on-premise, mobile, and cloud environments. And increase application performance.

With Red Hat Enterprise Java Solutions, you have everything you need to build, run, and manage services for Java EE6 enterprise applications.  Whether you are building an HTML5 mobile product, a highly transactional, distributed application - or anything in between - Red Hat Enterprise Java Solutions have you covered.

[[developer-studio]]Developer IDEs-such as link:http://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio/overview/[JBoss Developer Studio] help developers visualize, refactor, and test their code locally.

[[eap]]JBoss Enterprise Application Platorm (EAP) is a Java EE 6 application server, providing developers not only with all of the necessary plumbing to quickly build enterprise products, but also a light and fast enough platform to run on their laptops allowing rapid development and testing.

[[feedhenry]]The RedHat FeedHenry 3 Mobile Application Platform brings agility, visibility and efficiency to enterprise mobility. This Mobile App Platform embraces collaborative product development across multiple teams and projects and supports development "your way" with  Bring-Your-Own-Tools (BYOT). All of this designed to help you buid your products faster and meet the needs of your mobile customers.

[[xpaas]]JBoss xPaaS services provide the powerful capabilities of JBoss Middleware as cloud based services on OpenShift.

Developers can build applications, integrate with other systems, orchestrate using rules and processes, and then deploy across hybrid environments.
[[openshift]]OpenShift 3 is built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Atomic and Enterprise Linux. Origin Milestone 5 (M5) is the upstream community project that brings it all together along with extensions, to accelerate application development and deployment.

#### [[simplify-deployment]]Simplify Deployment
[[cloud]][[hybrid]]To deploy seamlessly across on-premise, private-cloud, and public-cloud environments, an application must allow for multiple deployment options from the same code base.

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform for xPaaS extends Java&trade; EE application platform capabilities to OpenShift by Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions to let you do just that. Don't start over from scratch or compromise on enterprise performance. Deploy or move your applications to the cloud quickly, with the simplicity of PaaS.

#### [[accelerate-performance]] Accelerate Product Performance
[[performance]][[jdg]]As transactions from your popular applications grow, data can be hard to access in a timely manner. You could spend more money on additional database licenses or an army of database administrators. Or, you could use Red Hat JBoss Data Grid, which lets you:
Achieve 3-times-faster application performance.
Effortlessly process huge volumes of data.
Scale for high-transaction throughput.
Concentrate on coding web applications instead of solving scaling problems.

[[thermostat]][[testing]]The best time to figure out how to increase product performance is before you need it.  link:http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Thermostat[Thermostat], part of link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/1/html/Software_Collections_Guide/[Red Hat Software Collections], is an instrumentation tool for the Hotspot JVM, with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances on multiple hosts, optionally in a cloud environment.  Using Thermostat, you can find the bottlenecks in your product and tune it for performance.

[[openjdk]][[shenandoah]]To drive product performance, we need an enterprise class VM to run them on.  As our products grow and we scale to large systems, we need a performant garbage collector to avoid 'Stop the World'.  Shenandoah is Red Hat's ultra high performance garbage collector for OpenJDK.

### [[tools]]Tools and Infrastructure
#### Code
Red Hat provides support for multiple versions of C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Node, Python, Ruby and many more languages.

Check out the versions of link:https://access.redhat.com/products/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/Developer/#dev-page=5[Python], link:https://access.redhat.com/products/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/Developer/#dev-page=5[Ruby], link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013[Java] and link:https://access.redhat.com/products/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/Developer/#dev-page=5[JavaScript] available within link:/products/software-collections[Red Hat Software Collections].

Seamless integration with link:/products/openshift[OpenShift] allows you to quickly get up and running with your codebase.

#### Build Tools
Build automation should be advanced enough to eliminate human intervention entirely in the process. To achieve this the build needs to be complete, so that the end result is an artifact that could be installed into a virgin environment and run.. Various approaches can be adopted in migrating to the target build time; for example, the code may offer the option to modularize the build so that only a partial build may be needed for most commits. Then full builds may be run less frequently, maybe nightly or weekly depending on how long they take to execute.

The build manager—such as link:http://ant.apache.org[Apache Ant], link:http://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] to create the application (providing test reports as it does so).

#### [[containers]]Containers
Deploy a secure, integrated host platform that is designed to run container images with optimizations for scalability, density, and performance.

Build and run image-based containers using the docker service, accessible through the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/265523[Extras] channel as part of a link:/products/rhel[Red Hat Enterprise Linux] subscription or choose link:/products/atomic[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host], a secure, lightweight and minimized footprint operating system that is optimized to run Linux containers.

#### [[source-control]]Source Control
While not a new concept, it’s essential that all project source code and build components are maintained in a single repository. The repository must contain not just the source code, but all the assets needed to build, deploy, and test the software; this may include test scripts, property/configuration files, database schema, install scripts, and third-party libraries. Red Hat can provide you with supported versions of git and svn
