If you’d like to use FeedHenry, you can apply here for an invitation to our new OpenShift-Online-backed offering which we launched at Red Hat Summit in June 2015. The only thing you’ll need is a free or paid account on link:http://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].

Due to overwhelming demand, we have to release these invitations in batches but you can expect to get access very soon.

In the meantime, you can learn more using the wide range of instructional material on the link:http://docs.feedhenry.com[FeedHenry Docs site]. This includes:
