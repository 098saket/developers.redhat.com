### How do I use OpenShift Online? 

To use OpenShift Online and take advantage of the power and elasticity of the Cloud, you only need to do the following:

1. Sign up for OpenShift Online - (need link). 
2. Create an "Application" in OpenShift Online (with the web console, command-line tools, or your IDE)
3. Code the application in your favorite environment, or use one of the available Quickstarts.
4. Push the application code to OpenShift Online (using Git)

    // Create the app based on an existing GitHub repository,
    // And it all gets set up in the cloud
    rhc create-app twt python-3.3 mongodb-2.4 --from-code git://github.com/openshift/openshift-twt-mongo-demo.git

    // Need to make a change? A local Git repository is checked out into ./twt
    cd twt

    // .... change some code ...
   git commit -a -m "My first change"
   git push origin master

   // And now your changes are live online


That's all there is to it. Simple, right?
