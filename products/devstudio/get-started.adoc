Install JBoss Developer Studio Integration Stack (Optional)

## Extra section

The Integration Stack for JBoss Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides tooling for the following products: JBoss Fuse, JBoss Fuse Service Works, JBoss BRMS and JBoss BPM Suite.

To install the Integration Stack tools, first install JBoss Developer Studio from the all-in-one installer (follow the installation steps link:#installation-instructions[above]).
This installer is bundled and configured out of the box with everything you need to get started.
Alternatively, if you already have eclipse-jee-kepler installed, you can install JBoss Developer Studio or JBoss Tools from the Eclipse Marketplace via Help > Eclipse Marketplace...

Once Developer Studio is installed, restart Eclipse and select the Software/Update tab in the JBoss Central view and look for the JBoss Developer Studio Integration Stack installation section.
Select the items youâ€™d like to install:

If you want to try out Savara you will need to use the JBoss Tools Integration Stack URL instead: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/kepler/integration-stack

*Note:* If you installed into your own Eclipse you should bump up the launch resource parameters:

    --launcher.XXMaxPermSize 256m --launcher.appendVmargs -vmargs -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6 -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
