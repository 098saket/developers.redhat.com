== Overview

Data grids are in-memory distributed databases designed for scalability and fast access to large volumes of data.  More than just a distributed caching solution, data grids also offer additional functionality such as map/reduce, querying, processing for streaming data, and transaction capabilities.  

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid supercharges today's modern applications and allows developers to meet tough requirements of high performance, availability, reliability, and elastic scale. JBoss Data Grid is compatible with the existing data tier as well as applications written in any language, using any framework and any platform via multiple APIs such as memcached, HotRod, and REST. Developers obtain a streamlined approach to standing up new applications, avoiding the challenges normally associated with integrating applications and traditional databases. A subscription includes management tooling (via the JBoss Operations Network plug-in), unlimited access for remote clients, and advanced functionality making JBoss Data Grid an ideal solution for cost-effectively supercharging today's modern applications.
