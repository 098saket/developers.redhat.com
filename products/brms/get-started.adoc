== Installation

1. Make sure you have a JDK of your choice installed. We recommend OpenJDK or Oracle JDK. https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/119933[Read more...]

2. Extract the contents of the standalone zip archive to install the server. This creates the *brms-standalone-5.3.0* directory which includes an installation of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform with JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform deployed.

3. Enable Users. The default configuration uses the BRMS JAAS application profile. This profile stores user names and passwords in the *brms-standalone-5.3.0/jboss-as/server/default/conf/props/brms-users.properties* file.
   Users are added by adding entries to this file in the format *username=password*. Entries can be commented out by adding a hash character (#) to the beginning of the line.

 #admin=password
 jsmith=s@r@hSm1th
 tandrews=pp3rrss0nn3ll

4. Start the server from the command line with the run.sh command on a UNIX or Linux system, or run.bat on a Microsoft Windows system.
+
 [localhost ]$ ./run.sh -c default
