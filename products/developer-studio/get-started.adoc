**Instructions for Installation**

Installation prerequisites:

- Install a JDK of your choice.  We recommend OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.

In Windows or Mac, you can start the installer by double clicking on the JAR file.

In Linux, open a terminal window in the target machine and navigate to where the GUI installer was downloaded.  Launch the GUI installer by executing the following command:

 java -jar jbdevstudio-product-universal-7.1.x.build_version.jar
